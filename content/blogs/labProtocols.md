# Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice

## In 2018, the Committee on Professional Ethics of the American Statistical Association crafted guidelines for integrating ethics into statistical analysis

### These guidlines are intended to help statisticians to make ethical decisions and promotion accountability by informing the stats community on what standards should be accepted

#### Our lab works in accordance with these guidlines with an emphasis on the following priciples:

**PROFESSIONAL INTEGRITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY**

The ethical statistician uses methodology and data that are relevant and appropriate; without favoritism or prejudice; and in a manner intended to produce valid, interpretable, and reproducible results. The ethical statistician does not knowingly accept work for which he/she is not sufficiently qualified, is honest with the client about any limitation of expertise, and consults other statisticians when necessary or in doubt. It is essential that statisticians treat others with respect.

**INTEGRITY OF DATA AND METHODS**

The ethical statistician is candid about any known or suspected limitations, defects, or biases in the data that may affect the integrity or reliability of the statistical analysis. Objective and valid interpretation of the results requires that the underlying analysis recognizes and acknowledges the degree of reliability and integrity of the data.

**RESPONSIBILITIES TO SCIENCE**

The ethical statistician supports valid inferences, transparency, and good science in general, keeping the interests of the public, funder, client, or customer in mind (as well as professional colleagues, patients, the public, and the scientific community).

**RESPONSIBILITIES TO RESEARCH SUBJECTS**

`The ethical statistician protects and respects the rights and interests of human and animal subjects at all stages of their involvement in a project. This includes respondents to the census or to surveys, those whose data are contained in administrative records, and subjects of physically or psychologically invasive research.`

**RESPONSIBILITIES TO COLLEAGUES**

Science and statistical practice are often conducted in teams made up of professionals with different professional standards. The statistician must know how to work ethically in this environment.

**RESPONSIBILITIES TO OTHER STATISTICIANS**

The practice of statistics requires consideration of the entire range of possible explanations for observed phenomena, and distinct observers drawing on their own unique sets of experiences can arrive at different and potentially diverging judgments about the plausibility of different explanations. Even in adversarial settings, discourse tends to be most successful when statisticians treat one another with mutual respect and focus on scientific principles, methodology, and the substance of data interpretations.

# Open-Source and Open-Data Analysis

## Our lab puts a strong emphasis on open-source and open-data statistical analysis to aid in creating a community of students, researchers, and statisticians who can learn from one another and collaborate together

```
Open data is the idea that all data should be available, and accessible under 
terms that permit re-use and redistribution. This form of collaboration 
and analysis should ensure that any person can use data for research, and 
distribute said research with no discrimination against fields or persons
```

```
Open source research is any form of investigation that exhausts 
publicly available information. In addition to using open-data, our lab 
focuses on ensuring that the research is publicaly available to the our community
