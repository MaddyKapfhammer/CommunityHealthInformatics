## What is Statistics

### Statistics is the science concerned with developing and studying methods for collecting, analyzing, interpreting and presenting emperical data.

**Statistics is a highly interdiscplinary field!**

## Important Vocabulary

**PROBABILITY:** The measure of the likelihood than an event will occur in a random experiment

    Conditional Proability: A measure of the probability of one event occcurring with some relationship to one or more other events

    Independent Events: Two events are independent if the occurrence of one dones not affect the probability of occurrence of the other

    Mutually Exclusive Events: Two events that cannot occur at the same time

    Bayes' Thorem describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

**VARIABILITY**

    Percentiles: A measure that indicates the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations falls

    Quantiles: Values that divide datapoints into four more or less equal quarters

    Interquartile Range (IQR): A measure of statistical dispersion and variability based on quartiles

    Variance: The average square difference of values from mean to measure how spread out a set of data is relative to mean

    Standard Deviation: The standard difference between each data point and the mean and the square root of variance

    Standard Error (SE): An estimate of the standard deviation of the sampling distribution

**VARIABLE RELATIONSHIPS**

    Casuality: Relationship between two events, where one is affected by the other

    Covariance: A quantitative measure of the joint variability between two or more variables

    Correlation: Measure the relationships between two variables and ranges from -1 to 1, the nromalized version of covariance

**HYPOTHESIS TESTING AND STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANT**

    Null Hypothesis: A general statement that there is no relationship between two measured events or no association among groups

    Alternative Hypothesis: There is a relationship between two measured variables, or an association among groups

    Type I Error: The rejection of a true null hypothesis

    Type II Error: Failure to reject a false null hypothesis

**VARIABLES**

    Categorical Variable: Variables that can be put into categories

    Confounding Variable: Extra variables that have a hidden effect on experimental results

    Continuous Variable: A variable with an infinite number of values, such as time

    Control Variable: A factor in an experiment which must be held constant

    Dependent Variable: The outcome of an experiment

    Discrete Variable: A variable that can only hold a certain number of variables

    Independent Variable: A variable that is not affected by the manipulation of a researcher

    Nominal Variable: Another name for a categorical variable

    Ordinal Variable: A categorical variable where there is a clear order, such as levels of income or education

    Qualitative Variable: A broad category for any variable that can't be counted, including nominal and ordinal variables

    Quantitative Variable: A broad category that includes any variable that ccan be counted, or has a numerical value associated with it, including discrete variables

## Types of Statistical Tests

```Parametric tests assume that the data at hand is normally distributed```

```Non-parametric tests assume that the data at hand is not normally distributed```

**One sample t-test:** Test whether a sample mean significantly differs from a hypothesized value

**One sample median test:** Test whether a sample median differs significantly from a hypothesized value

**Binomial test:** Test whether the proportion of successes on a two-level categorical dependent variable significantly differs from a hypothesized value

**Chi-square goodness of fit:** Test whether the observed proportions for a categorical variable differ from hypothesized proportions

**Paired t-test:** Test to see if the means on two normally distributed interval variables differ from one another

**Chi-square test:** Determine if there is a relationship betwen two categorical variables

**One-way ANOVA:** Test for differences in the means of a dependent variable broken down by the levels of independent variables. Used when there is a categorical independent variable and a normally distributed interval dependent variable

**Correlation:** Determines the relationship between two (or more) normally distrubuted interval variables

**Simple linear regression:** Investigate the linear relationship between one normally distrubuted interval predictor and one normally distributed interval outcome variable.
